"# Rook-Polynomial" 

to use this code you don't need to give the board size.

this code will get an string from you.

let's say you gave this : 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 1 6 7
then Your coordinates will be like this :

(1,1),(2,1),(3,2),(4,1),(6,7)

0	0	0	0	0	0	1\n
0	0	0	0	0	0	0\n
1	0	0	0	0	0	0\n
0	1	0	0	0	0	0\n
1	0	0	0	0	0	0\n
1	0	0	0	0	0	0\n

and the rook polynomial like this : 1+5x^1+7x^2+3x^3.

be careful given coordinates should be positiv.
(coordinates start from 1 both in x and y directions.)
